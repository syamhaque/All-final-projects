General Instructions:

1. First begin by running the program by going to the folder bin and typing "./Chess" (omitting quotes) into the command line.

2. Select the game mode desired (Player vs Player or Player vs AI), white goes first! If user chooses to play against the AI then they can choose the color they desire.

3. To move, select the space of the piece that is desired to move, then select another space to move the piece there, assuming said space is legal. If move is not legal, game will prompt user to select another space.

4. The black player then repeats step 2.

5. If a user is in check, the game will display that this user is currently in check.

6. When the game ends, the user will be prompted to start a new game, or quit. If the user wishes to, they may also view a log of all the moves that have taken place during their game.
