I tried reimplementing all the previous DIPs functions as best as I could, but could not properly output the correct image for the Edge and Sharpen functions. The crop function is made to output just a certain portion of our HSSOE image, while resize is made to enlarge or shrink the HSSOE image. The brightness and contrast functions are made to edit the pixels of the HSSOE image to make the image itself lighter or darker, and the brightness between region or objects in the image. I was also able to get watermark to work to output a transparent image ontop of our original one.
