I created all the ImageList functions by referencing our lecture notes and the Movie functions by loosely referencing the Image function and the assignment hints for the equations of the conversion functions. I implemented the command line the way I did as it seemed like a simple way to make sure all the DIPs functions get applied in the order they are supposed to. I could not get to Spotlight or properly check valgrind for whatever memory leaks.
